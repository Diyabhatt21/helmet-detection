Helmet safety is very important because it helps protect your head from serious injuries during accidents, especially in activities like:

Riding a bike, motorcycle, or scooter

Working on construction sites

Playing contact sports (like football or hockey)

Riding skateboards or rollerblades

Why Helmets Are Important:
Protect Your Brain: Helmets absorb the impact of a fall or crash and reduce the risk of brain injuries.

Prevent Skull Fractures: They create a cushion between your skull and the hard surface.

Save Lives: Wearing a helmet can reduce the risk of death by over 40% in road accidents.

Required by Law: In many places, wearing a helmet while riding a bike or working in hazardous areas is mandatory.

Features of a Safe Helmet:
Strong outer shell (to prevent objects from penetrating)

Inner foam lining (to absorb impact)

Secure straps (to keep the helmet in place)

Proper fit (not too tight or loose)

Safety certification mark (like ISI, DOT, ECE)

Tips for Helmet Safety:
Always wear the helmet properly.

Replace a helmet after a crash or every few years.

Never wear a cracked or broken helmet.

Choose a helmet made for your activity (e.g., bike helmet vs. construction helmet)
